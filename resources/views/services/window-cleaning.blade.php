        <h1>Window Cleaning</h1>
        <p>Window cleaning is either carried out using traditional methods or the Ionic high reach telescopic pole.</p>
        <p>High level window cleaning is carried out from the safety of the ground, using the Ionic, high reach telescopic pole, which can reach 80ft in height, negating the use of ladders.</p>
        <p>A soft bristled brush is used to scrub the dirt off the glass, while jets of pure water rinse the window.</p>
        <p>Pure water is used as it has no impurities and dries to a spot-free finish leaving no marks behind.</p>
        <p>The water fed pole is eco-friendly and can be used to clean window frames, sills, soffits and fasciaâ€™s. This enables us to clean higher, faster and safer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Co-workers are trained in the safe use of ladder and steps, working at height methods and health &amp; safety awareness</p></li>
            <li><p>We use the best industry recognised equipment</p></li>
            <li><p>We carry out our own risk assessments</p></li>
