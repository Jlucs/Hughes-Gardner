    <h1>Multi-Site Contracts And Standalone Clients</h1>

        <li><p>Low staff turnover, with all staff trained to cover sickness and holidays</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Service delivery incorporates daily cleaning services; lunch time / day janitor services; hygiene and washroom services; window and facade services, carpet cleaning services, rapid response, waste and recycling services and specialist cleaning.</p>
    <p><b>Day to day cleaning</b> using environmentally friendly products which are non-hazardous and biodegradable. We Implement a Cross Contamination Control Colour Coding System to control contamination in all areas. <b>We use environmentally friendly and biodegradable cleaning products and are committed to creating a cleaner environment.</b></p>
    <p>All staff receive training to complete their allotted tasks in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.</p>
    <p>We have contingency plans for all eventualities, including detailed contract implementation plans and on the awardement of any contract it follows a step-by-step guide to the sequence of events before.</p>
    <p><b>High level window cleaning</b> is carried out from the safety of the ground, using the Ionic, high reach telescopic pole, which can reach 80ft in height. A soft bristled brush is used to scrub the dirt off the glass, while jets of pure water rinse the window.</p>
    <p>Pure water is used as it has no impurities and dries to a spot-free finish leaving no marks behind.</p>
    <p>The water fed pole is eco-friendly and can be used to clean window frames, sills, soffits and fascia’s. This enables us to clean higher, faster and safer.</p>
    <p><b>Carpet cleaning</b> procedures, that require a specialised service, benefit from specific operatives trained in industry recognised programmes. Prochem Europe Ltd, a leading manufacturer of cleaning and maintenance products provide the latest training for carpets, upholstery and floor maintenance helping to protect and maintain their appearance.</p>
